# Enoch Liu’s Spring 2024 Portfolio

I attend CSUF and will probably graduate in 2028.

## Labs

* Lab  9b

I like this lab because we learned about file streams and how to apply them.  I personally feel that getting words from file streams are more useful and can be implemented in the future.  This one was also satisfying to solve as I had an error trying to code it.

* Lab 10

I like this part of the lab because we learned about 2D vectors and how to apply them.  I personally feel that 2D vectors are more useful and can be implemented in the future.  This one was also satisfying to solve as I had an error trying to code it.

* Lab 7

I like this part of the lab because we learned about 2D vectors and how to apply them.  I personally feel that 2D vectors are more useful and can be implemented in the future.  This one was also satisfying to solve as I had an error trying to code it.
